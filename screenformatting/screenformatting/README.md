# screenformatting

This is my screen formatting project repo. The languages being used are Fortran, Ada, Cobol, Lisp, Rust, & Julia.
I've had many personal and health related issues lately that have caused me to not do the kind of work nor the quality I would have liked in the past month.
I'd like to talk to you in your office hours at some point.
